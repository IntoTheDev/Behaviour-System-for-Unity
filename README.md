# Behaviour System for Unity
Universal behaviour system for all kinds of entities.

Files usage:

BehaviourProcessor - main script that will contain all states of the object.

State - state of an entity that contains events to change behaviour.

Also i'm using [NaughtyAttributes](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes) for some attributes and [ToolBoxEditor](https://github.com/IntoTheDev/ToolBox/blob/master/ToolBoxEditor.cs) for editor methods.
